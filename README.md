# Azure IoT Edge Modbus Module Preview #
Using this module, developers can build Azure IoT Edge solutions with Modbus TCP/RTU(RTU is currently not available in Windows container) connectivity. The Modbus module is an [Azure IoT Edge](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge) module, capable of reading data from Modbus devices and publishing data to the Azure IoT Hub via the Edge framework. Developers can modify the module tailoring to any scenario. Alternatively, the module can also be run in standalone mode for debug purpose, which doesn't require IoT Edge framework.

- [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux)


## Build Environment Setup ##
Modbus module is a .NET Core 2.0 application, which is developed and built based on the guidelines in Azure IoT Edge document.
Please follow [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/tutorial-csharp-module) to setup the build environment. 

Basic requirement:
- Docker CE
- .NET Core 2.0 SDK (optional, if you prefer to manually build application on host machine)

## HowTo Build ##
In this section, the Modbus TCP module we be built as an IoT Edge module.

Dockerfiles are located under [Docker](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-modbus/tree/master/Docker) folder, you should be able to find one for your platform. There are two Dockerfiles in each platform, choose either one for your build preference.
- "Dockerfile-auto": For multi-stage build, which will build application inside container and generate a target container image. 
- "Dockerfile": This requires you to build applicaiton on host machine and then use this Dockerfile to copy application binary to generate target container image.  

**Note**: [Multi-stage](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-modbus#multi-stage-build) build for Linux-arm32 doesn't work at this moment, please do with [single-stage](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-modbus#single-stage-build) build.  
**Note**: Please replace \<platform\> in below scripts with the actual platform path you are trying to build.

### Build as an IoT Edge module ###
1. Open "Program.cs" file in [src](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-modbus/tree/master/src) folder.
2. Confirm **IOT_EDGE** flag is enabled at first line code.
```csharp
#define IOT_EDGE
```

#### Multi-stage build ###
Run docker build with the following commands.
```sh
$cd iot-edge-modbus/
$docker build -t "modbus:latest" -f Docker/<PlatForm>/Dockerfile-auto .
```

#### Single-stage build ####
Run docker build with the following commands.
```sh
$cd iot-edge-modbus/src/
$dotnet restore

## Module Endpoints and Routing ##
There are two endpoints defined in Modbus TCP module:  
- "modbusOutput": This is a output endpoint for telemetries. All read operations defined in configuration will be composed as telemetry messages output to this endpoint.
- "input1": This is an input endpoint for write commands.

Input/Output message format and Routing rules are introduced below.

### Read from Modbus ###

#### Telemetry Message ####
Message Properties: 
```json
"content-type": "application/edge-modbus-json"
```
Message Payload:
```json
[
  {
    "DisplayName":"Voltage",
    "HwId":"PowerMeter-0a:01:01:01:01:01",
    "Address":"400001",
    "Value":"19775",
    "SourceTimestamp":"2017-11-17 08:43:50"
  },
  {
    "DisplayName":"Current",
    "HwId":"PowerMeter-0a:01:01:01:01:01",
    "Address":"400002",
    "Value":"15650",
    "SourceTimestamp":"2017-11-17 08:43:50"
  }
]
```

#### Route to IoT Hub ####
```json
{
  "routes": {
    "modbusToIoTHub":"FROM /messages/modules/modbus/outputs/modbusOutput INTO $upstream"
  }
}
```

#### Route to other (filter) modules ####
```json
{
  "routes": {
    "modbusToFilter":"FROM /messages/modules/modbus/outputs/modbusOutput INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/filtermodule/inputs/input1\")"
  }
}
```

### Write to Modbus ###
Modbus module use input endpoint "input1" to receive commands. Currently it supports writing back to a single register/cell in a Modbus slave.  

#### Command Message ####
The content of command must be the following message format.  

Message Properties: 
```json
"command-type": "ModbusWrite"
```

Message Payload:
```json
{
  "HwId":"PowerMeter-0a:01:01:01:01:01",
  "UId":"1",
  "Address":"40001",
  "Value":"15"
}
```

#### Route from other (filter) modules ####
The command should have a property "command-type" with value "ModbusWrite". Also, routing must be enabled by specifying rule like below.
```json
{
  "routes": {
    "filterToModbus":"FROM /messages/modules/filtermodule/outputs/output1 INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/modbus/inputs/input1\")"
  }
}
```

## HowTo Run ##

### Run as an IoT Edge module ###
Please follow the [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/tutorial-csharp-module) to deploy the module as an IoT Edge module.

#### Configure Modbus RTU ####
This is for Modbus RTU only, Modbus TCP could skip this section.

In the **Container Create Option section**, enter the following for device mapping.
```json
{
  "HostConfig": {
    "Devices": [
      {
        "PathOnHost": "<device name on host machine>",
        "PathInContainer": "<device name in container>",
        "CgroupPermissions": "rwm"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Debug from Visual Studio 2017 ##
Running debug mode requires IoT device connection string being inserted as a environment variable named **EdgeHubConnectionString**, and a local configuration file "iot-edge-modbus.json" since module twin is not available under debug mode. You can copy "iot-edge-modbus.json" template from project root directory to working directory and modify the content to fit your test case.  

**Note**: running in debug mode means none of the IoT Edge features is available. This mode is only to debug non edge-related functions. 

1. Open "iot-edge-modbus.csproj" with **Visual Studio 2017**.
2. Open "Program.cs" file in [src](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-modbus/tree/master/src) folder.
3. Confirm **IOT_EDGE** flag is disabled at first line code.
```csharp
// #define IOT_EDGE
```
4. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** to build project.
5. Go to **Project** and select **iot-edge-modbus Properties...**
6. Switch to **Debug** tab.
7. Add **Environment variables** with **Name** = "EdgeHubConnectionString", and **Value** = "\<your IoT device connection string\>". The connection string can be found from Azure Portal.
8. Press F5 to run project.
