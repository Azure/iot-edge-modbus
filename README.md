# Beta Azure IoT Gateway Modbus Module
Using this module, developers can build Azure IoT Gateway solutions with Modbus connectivity. The Modbus module is a [Azure IoT Gateway SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk) module, capable of reading data from Modbus devices and publish the data to the Azure IoT Hub via a message broker. Developers can modify the module tailoring to any scenario.
